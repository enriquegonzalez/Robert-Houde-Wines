          Robert Houde President
          <p>
          Robert Houde began his wine career in restaurants, amassing nine years of fine dining experience before joining the world-renowned Charlie Trotter’s in 1994.  After four intense years with the Charlie Trotter’s wine team, he was promoted to head som-melier, and helped the restaurant achieve The Wine Spectator Award for “America’s Best Restaurant,” The Wine Spectator Reader’s Poll Award for “Best Restaurant in the World for Wine &amp; Food,” and the James Beard Award for “Outstanding Restaurant” in 2000.

          Robert moved to the Import/Wholesale side of the wine business in 2001, joining Vin Divino Ltd., where he handled key restaurant and retail accounts, and managed several top portfolios, includ-ing Terry Theise Estate Selections, Rosenthal Wine Merchant, Peter Vezan Selections, and World Sake Imports.  In 2005, he began helping famed Spanish importer Jorge Ordoñez expand his distribution in Illinois, and in 2009, opened Robert Houde Wines with partner Mark Hutchens.

          Robert Houde Wines now represents over 180 fine wine estates, including Marc de Grazia Selections, Terry Theise Estate Selections, Europvin-Christopher Cannan Selections, and several Robert Houde Wines direct imports.

          Mark Hutchens Vice President
          <p>
          Mark Hutchens has worked in nearly all aspects of the wine business beginning in 1989, before he was of legal drinking age. Working his way up from stock boy to retail manager and eventu-ally into distribution, Mark finally ended up in New York as Na-tional Sales Manager for Michael Skurnik Wines. His most formative experience came under the mentorship of Terry Theise, with whom Mark spent months each year at origin during his tenure, and continued to represent the wines in different positions around the US before co-founding Robert Houde Wines in 2009.

          Although Mark is still considered a specialist in German, Austrian and Champagne wines, he is equally informed and engaged in the wines of Italy, France and Spain. Mark values distinction in wine above all else and considers a wines’ strong identity its most important measure of quality.

          Mark shares in all the responsibilities at RHW, contributing to the sourcing of the portfolio and managing key accounts in the Chicago area.
